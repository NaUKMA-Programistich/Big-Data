47960,DeepThoughts,Who am I?,"You could take any one cell in my body and kill it, I would still be me. Yet, if you kill them all, I am no more. Who then am I? Am I the cells? Am I the network of the cells working in unison? If I am constantly shedding cells and making new ones, then am I someone different than who I was before?

For what benefit am I here? For ""me""? For my cells? Perhaps for the information my cells contain?

Ah, DNA. Information. Perhaps I am information. Perhaps all life is part of a vast network of information. But why? Who is this information for?

If the greatest book ever written spontaneously appeared in a forest, yet was never read, and disappeared the same way it appeared, if no one knew that it came or went, would it still have purpose? Meaning? Did it ever really exist if it was never observed by a conscious observer? If no one read the words or even knew there were words to read, does that mean there was never a message?

Who am I?

Who is this universe? For what purpose do lighter elements give birth to stars and galaxies which in turn give birth to planets and life? Are we a book that is not read? Do we even exist all? Does purpose even matter?

I will be bold and say it matters. I will have courage and say ""I am"". If I am wrong I will rest forever.

But if I am right...

If someone out there is reading our book, learning from our information of our universe then... we have purpose.

Or better yet, what if we are writing our own book? What if we are reading our own book? What if we create our own purpose? What if the concept of God is non-existence bringing forth existence and trying to determine what exactly that means?

In the end it seems there are no answers. Answers only lead to more questions. I put forth to you that the most direct evidence for ""God"", whatever you perceive God to be, or not to be (you can just substitute all of existence for God in that case), is the fact that there are questions in the first place. Nothing exist without a question. All of existence began with this question:

47978,DeepThoughts,Life is something bigger than yourself,"Human beings do not exist on their own.

Everything we eat must come from what is living.

The air that we breathe is created by bacteria, algae, plants and trees. They have even created our atmosphere which protects us from deadly radiation.

We view ourselves as individuals and separate from the bacteria, algae, plants and trees, but truly, we are all part of the same thing and share common ancestors. This is true.

---

There was a time when not a single plant or tree grew, and not a single creature walked the land.

3.5 Billion years ago or so, and likely much earlier, some of the earliest forms of life made their appearance. And since then, for millions and billions of years, continuously replicating themselves, facing new environments, changing form, and consuming/eating one another, and interacting with each other; life developed into various forms.

All life that you see today, probably came from the same origins of this archaic life. The trees, the insects .. you! That's right you!

All of the cells in anything that is living share common ancestors.

It's hard to believe, but the evidence is there for you to see.. every step of the way.

We are not separate from life.. we are a part of life.. a greater system.. greater than yourself.

Truly, we are one with the rest of the living world.

---

Many humans (and possibly non-humans) have grown arrogant. Feeling like they control things, and own the world, but it is the other way around - nature (in a sense) owns you, for you are a part of nature.

Like bees who go about doing what they do, unaware that they also help to proliferate the plant life on this great system, so we go about doing what we do, maybe unaware of the role we play in a greater system.

Many people feel like we are responsible for continuing life on this Earth; as if it is in our hands for it to continue to exist - but this is false.

The existence of humans may be in jeopardy, but the existence of life is not dependent upon us. Life permeates almost every rock. It is not going anywhere.

Mildly NSFW?,"I believe that as long as discriminating against others based off of race or sexuality is present in society, peace is harder to achieve. I believe it to be primitive thinking and see it is as a worthy foe. However, despite all of this, I also believe that people need to take a step back and see things from both sides every now and then. Also, realize that if the cause you are fighting for truly improves American society and freedom, it will prevail. Many claims are made stating that homosexuality infringes upon religious freedom. It should not but due to the way that these matters are handled, the issue surrounding this is obvious. No one is willing to compromise for the better of humankind as a whole. Everyone wants to be comfortable with their beliefs being the only truth, despite how biased they may be. This has turned all of these rights movements into giant political dick measuring contests. People don't just want their equal rights, they want to be the only true way. They want to ""win"". It is this flawed thinking that causes the true fault in democracy. Democracy without compromise is just one big bowl of differentiating opinions that never mix.

48034,DeepThoughts,Is love really stronger than hate?,"I was thinking about it this morning because of a mean comment on Reddit. I'm not stating any of this as absolute fact (or an endorsement of hate!), but just as food for thought.

Hate is easier to act on than love, and sustains itself longer.

Hate feeds on itself, and even gives confidence and courage. If you're hateful, the negative response only gives your hate more fuel, a continued focus. It doesn't listen to reason, and it reliably elicits the desired response.

Love isn't necessarily as reliable for getting a ""reap what you sow"" response. I've known *plenty* of extremely kind people who just ended up being taken advantage of because they're *that* person: the one who you call when you need something, and get outraged if they say no. ""I thought you were a nice person, but I guess I was wrong...""

Here's where it relates to trolling. There are hateful things you could say to a complete stranger that would hurt them for *years*, and might leave them hating you (and thinking about you) for even longer. ""I can't believe you're married, because who would go on a first date with someone who's *that* fucking disgusting?""

But what could you say to a complete stranger to evoke an equal level of deep, consuming *love* for years?

""I want you to know you're beautiful""? That might give them a glow for weeks, but being human, they'd end up doubting you. ""But my arms are flabby, my lips are too thin, my left eye is a little off center,"" et cetera.

It's easy to get strong hate from people; as easy as insulting them for how they look or what they care about. Judging by the amount of lonely, unloved-feeling people out there, it can be very hard to make people love you.

Again, not an endorsement of hate. Sorry if this was a downer, but I wanted to share it somewhere.

**tl;dr**: You can make someone deeply hate you by trolling, but it's hard to make people love you.",13,1419265782,9,0
48037,DeepThoughts,A Few Facts,"
I never met a ""good"" person in my entire life. Typically, people are a shade of Grey, sometimes they are Black, but they are never White. Humans are just animals, nothing more, nothing less. A lot of people could be better than what they are, but they choose not to be. People will show you their true colors when you are down and out, so don't assume that you are loved by everyone if you are doing well financially. We don't need a lot of the stuff that we have, but we are trained to believe that we do. The Native American way of life was a better way of life because it allowed people to live in harmony with nature instead of destroying it. The people who want power are always the ones who will abuse it. Privacy is a human right, and the people who deny a person that right should be punished. Religion always does more harm than good. We are all ""in this together"", so we should look out for each other so that life will be a little easier for everyone. Kindness is not a weakness, but it is usually seen that way. A person should not have to apologize for having a good life. The people who have bad parents should still be thankful for those parents because if it weren't for those ""bad parents"", they wouldn't even exist. Just because your life sucks doesn't mean mine should too. If you have been mistreated by someone in your life and you feel the need to spread misery, then you should make the person who mistreated you miserable, not the innocent. ",6,1419377639,2,0
48038,DeepThoughts,"If humanity did not exist, would the universe exist?","Without humans, do human concepts (like time) exist?

Sure, clocks would keep ticking, but without people, time as a concept is gone forever. Now one might argue that there may be other intelligent life who also keep time, but they have an entirely different, non-human concept of time. The case of other life forms existing that are intelligent enough to form their own concepts and perception of the universe is still entirely different. We have our unique perceptions and concepts and such, and if we ceased to exist, our universe (read: our perception of the universe) ceases to exist as well.

In my opinion, what's underneath the mask is just another mask. One after another, ready for any situation you are in. So, how do you define yourself, if you're still just acting even when alone, away from others? And how can others define who you are if you're still acting when around them?

With more deep self-awareness and *mindfulness* of it, perhaps they will start to wriggle themselves from the tight grip of those vices; loosen up the debilitating shackles of the selfish, lustful beasts inside them - and in becoming a better being, through the healthy prickles and disruption of mindfulness, they can *defeat* the vice, and control the implement, rather than helplessly letting it ... control them.

10741995,depression,Apathy is destroying my life,"I’m writing this little monologue because I don’t know what else to do. I’ve been apathetic for about a year now (probably because of a mix of anxiety and depression) and I have no clue how to change this feeling. I have so little motivation to do most things — I spend so much time lying around, watching YouTube, scrolling endlessly on Instagram, reading Reddit, et cetera — and I HATE it. The days I feel my best are when I get out of the house and do things the entire day. And I know what makes me feel happy and fulfilled: making new friends or hanging out with current friends, reading, coding, taking photos with my camera, making art, and a few other things. Yet I really can’t bring myself to do any of it. I constantly procrastinate on homework and miss class, and when I do work, it’s always in my bed (Yeah, I’m always lying down. Whether it’s to consume social media mindlessly or to do homework, I’m always in my bed). I can barely even bring myself to do the amount of work necessary to get a therapist, which feels like a monumental task. Everything feels so meaningless! Even things I enjoy doing feel meaningless. Yeah, it’s fun to code a small project, but I’ll never be as good as my friends, who are already getting jobs and starting companies. Everything I can code seems trivial. Yeah, it’s a good idea to do homework, but it all feels useless because grades don’t matter in college anyway. And I know I feel good whenever I spend most of the day out and about, yet it’s easier to stay in my dorm all day and my classes are boring and I can probably figure out the material on my own anyway. I know getting a therapist would help me figure my life out, but it’s so much effort to not only find a therapist but to have a consultation with them and to actually go through with meeting with them. I know watching Instagram and YouTube for hours every day makes me feel awful and is a complete waste of time, but breaking my habit of turning my brain off and scrolling endlessly requires so much effort and energy. I know I would feel better if I exercised more, but I’m really out of shape and there are so many people at the gym that I feel embarrassed, so I choose not to put my energy into going. I know I am more productive if I’m at a library or at my desk or just ANYTHING other than lying in bed all day, but I can’t help myself, I have a habit of just lying in my bed anyway. I know I could do things to fix my insomnia like only lying in bed when I’m trying to sleep or going to therapy to decrease my anxiety but it’s just so much effort. I know for a fact that I’m a smart person but can’t apply myself even though I want to. I think and think and think about everything, yet if I have a list of ten tasks to complete in a day, it’s almost impossible for me to get past the first one.

My point is that everything feels like a monumental cliff to climb. I convince myself to not really do anything because it’s all so exhausting. I need help, I really really want to get better and live a better life. I know that if I could apply myself, I’d accomplish a lot. Yet, after being STUCK for SO LONG, it’s genuinely really hard for me to actually be convinced that I can really change.

I do have an image in my mind of a truly fulfilling life. One where I have a set schedule every day that I actually follow rather than sitting around all day. One where I have a best friend or a group of close friends, rather than a loose network of friendships that don’t feel especially close. One where I’m actually able to work my brain and overcome hard problems instead of shutting my brain off for hours a day with Instagram and YouTube. One where I’m in an internship or job or research position and put 110% of my effort in, instead of doing the bare minimum to skirt by my classes.

I really, really WANT to change my situation. It just feels like I’ve made zero progress for the past year, so it’s hard for me to see if it’s even possible. I don’t feel less intelligent than many of my friends, it just feels like they are naturally more motivated and productive.

I need help convincing myself that I can change, because this has defined every moment of my life for what feels like forever now.",9,1672483279,3,1

10742006,depression,"I have a seemingly ""perfect"" life but I want to die","I'm currently a senior in high school. I go to a private school in NYC that costs 50k+ a year, I live in a super wealthy neighborhood, and my Dad has a whole PhD and makes 300k+ a year... AND I'm still dumb and useless.

Some context: I had a lot of ups and downs in middle school with eating disorders, which kind of bled into the beginning of high school. I was fatigued and depressed in freshman year so my grades fell to B+'s and then I had to leave school because I was suicidal. Some of the eating disorder and suicidal ideation were caused by trauma from my mom's death when I was 9-- we didn't really have a good relationship before she died ig.

Sophomore year was overall fine but then junior year happened and it was kind of rough tbh. I'm kind of a shit test taker and I genuinely thought I had a learning disability because throughout my life I noticed that I was never very focused in any setting and I was never good at taking standardized tests or any kind of tests tbh and I couldn't get anything higher than a 1350 SAT when I wanted a score above 1480. My sophomore year was great because I could cheat because classes were online. My grades ranged from mostly A's to a few B's. I was a bit depressed because I felt kind of unfulfilled. I go to an all-girls school where you don't hear a lot about parties, so I felt like there was nothing exciting. I probably had meaningful interactions with boys like 2 times a year lol.  I also wasn't very ""popular"" in my 50-person class so I definitely wasn't gonna meet any boys.

Then I went into summer feeling somewhat happy... then something bad happened. I don't really want to talk about it because that itself deserves its own post. The point is, I had nightmares about it for months, and I went into my senior year depressed and emotionless. I lost a lot of motivation. I was scheduled to take the SAT in October but my score fell significantly despite studying for months on end. Teachers kept on cramming in work for interim grades. Then my dad signed me up for the November and December SAT. By those two months, I was probably severely depressed. I hated going to school and I was having trouble doing homework. I also missed 5 days of school in total, which isn't a sick amount, but a good amount. Half the colleges I'm applying to are reaches, but I want to get into one of them really fucking badly. I know that getting into a good college doesn't ""define you"" or whatever, but it's hard to feel happy when you know people that your dad knows that have children that already are getting into T20 schools. I still have some time before semester grades are due, but I'm genuinely dreading going back to school because I just want to be done with school. My heart's not in it, but my semester grades have to be good. I'm seeing people get into Ivies on Instagram and here I am failing everything that's been set up for me. I have no self-control or motivation. The people from the bad thing this summer all got into their ED's. I feel so defeated and unhappy with my normal life. I'm never the person with the happy ending. I've had thoughts of suicide because I know I'm never going to live the life full of happiness, love, and success that I want. I want to redo my whole life, but I can't. Sometimes I even fantasize about my own death and that everyone who wronged me in some way would feel bad.

My friends are all out of the station and believe I am a social recluse since I refuse to go out so much. They have gone on their family trips and I do not expect them to accommodate me in any way. All I expected was periodic maybe weekly texts from the person I consider my best friend. I have no one to talk to other than her and honestly, When I look back, it was me who is talking most of the time. She either replies superficially or replies days later. I just expected people to show a little concern as to why I stopped being outgoing and closed up. I don't expect my friends to care much other than asking ""hey, how are you doing?"". That would mean a lot. Big none of them seem to care.
My parents think I am selfish for not wanting to get married in the future. My mom is now trying to gaslight me into thinking what a terrible decision that is. Like I don't see them holding on to a failing marriage every day.

10742091,depression,tonight might be the night,"i've never really tried to do it before, maybe this won't work and it'll just end up sucking, but i have an idea.

unfortunately i don't have a gun. if i did i would do it like that. but i can't, so heres my idea.

before i start, i'll run a nice bath. i don't usually take baths but its important.

i'm going to get weed, like maaaaaad weed, get baked off my fuckin' ass right? hopefully i get so high i wont even feel whats about to happen to me.

after i'm sufficiently stoned and in the bath i'll take a fuckton of ibuprofen. just gobble that shit up like they're skittles.

Then, just as a precaution, to make sure it works, i'll slice my wrist vertically.

If i fall unconscious, i'll drown in the tub. It probably wont be as peaceful as i imagine it will be, it will probably hurt alot, i'll probably freak out and fuck it up, but right now its all a can think about.

Happy new year everyone.",14,1672507708,11,1

That place nobody knows about. They know about 90% of you but that last 10% is the part they can't know about. It's impossible to explain or share. It's the most painful part of you. When you're there you feel totally alone and helpless. It's like a waking nightmare. It's paralyzing. You go over your options to fight and just end up not deciding on anything. It's too strong.

I'm there now. I'm crying horribly. I have to get up soon and take my dog to pee.  I have a roommate who I do care about but who doesn't fully understand and never will. I only have me in this state and it's so uniquely painful.",9,1672508238,2,1

10742108,depression,A good thing in the world this time,"Heyyy… you may remember me from my post about the guy who couldn’t afford a bunch or premie baby formula, but I actually have something good this time. It’s from a week or so ago, but still, thought it may be appreciated.

I was working the register again and someone came up, checking out a bunch of groceries and one toy. Got through with the food and all that and scanned the toy. It rang up $240. I can’t remember what it was but it was some sort of doll thing so it was ridiculously expensive for what it was. Before I rang it up she was telling me about how excited she was that she found that because her daughter had been wanting it for so long. She had told her daughter she couldn’t get it because it was so expensive and she really couldn’t afford it, but she saw that it was half off and she and her husband had gotten divorced so it had been a hard year for her daughter. That’s when it dawned on me, this wasn’t half off. Normally we could just honor the deal because the customer saw a sign or something but my store has a rule that if the amount that would be deducted is greater than $50, we can’t do it.

I broke the news and she just kind of stood there for a second and said “I can’t afford that… go ahead and put it back.” But apparently the person behind her overheard her talking about the hard year and her daughter and, without hesitation asked “What’s the price difference?”

I told her that it would have been $120 extra for full price. She opened her wallet, pulled out $120, slapped it down on the register and said “You’re doing so well, and your daughter is going to love it. Keep on going, honey.” The woman burst into tears and I definitely about started crying. The woman paid and I also saw that she was using food stamps so it was definitely legit.

Anyway, I know this was really long but it’s worth the read I think. That kind of generosity is all I needed that day.",4,1672511216,,1
10742127,depression,2022 to 2023 Depression,"It feels like nothing makes me happy anymore.

I’ve had a bit of a rough time over the past two years. Ever since COVID happened, it feels like the life was drained out of me. In November of 2020, I lost my grandpa on my dad’s side of the family due to a heart attack, and then months later in 2021, I lost both my grandparents on my mom’s side of the family within weeks of each other. Then in January of 2022, I got into a fender bender, and in September, my car’s engine failed, and on a Twitter account that I’ve since deleted, I got a copyright warning, and now I’m afraid I’m going to get sued sooner or later.

It just feels like I’m in an abyss of hopelessness, and I’m afraid of what the New Year will bring.

I’m afraid my parents will disown me for the mistakes I’ve made.

I try to appear happy on the outside, but within, I can’t hold it in any longer. Over the past months I’ve had nervous crying fits by myself (and as I write this, I’m having one right now).

I don’t know what to do anymore. I tried using the internet years ago to try and connect with people, but it’s only made things worse.

10742212,depression,"Depression, it’s a bitch but 🤷‍♂️","A lot of people will say “oH yOuRe dEpReSsEd wE aLl aRe” but it’s not the case, sadness is universal, everyone has 4 common feelings which is happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiousness, depression is completely different, it’s the feeling that time has simply stopped moving forward, like you are stuck in a certain point and there is no finish line. Depression is the feeling of nothing, and to feel nothing is the scariest thing of all, the feeling that you need to just go to bed, turn off the lights and avoid everyone you love because you are nothing but a burden. The feeling of being scared, alone, and hopeless all at once, I’ve been battling depression my entire life and didn’t realize it until I was 18, it’s just a feeling you have when the world is on your shoulders but you have nowhere to put it. It’s crippling, like you can’t walk, eat, talk, or function but you know you have to so nobody sees you that way, because the hardest part about having depression is hiding it. It’s easiest when you have the flu or a cold because you can stay home and people just say “oh he’s sick” yeah, I’ve been sick for awhile, to know that you can’t function unless you are at 100% if I go to work sick then I can’t fight my depression and it is showed to everyone and in my head everyone is looking at me with pity when I’m usually this strong personality. Everyone knows Robin Williams was depressed but nobody knew until after he took his own life. He was such a charismatic person but nobody could see what was really going on behind closed doors. He was able to look at a camera but could barely look in the mirror, I can’t look in the mirror, not really anymore because I feel bad for myself, I always ask myself why I feel this way or why I have this fucking disease in my head but I can never get a clear answer because the truth is there is no answer for it, there is no cure, there is no way to feel better, the only way to deal with it is to… well there is no way to deal with it besides find the best way to move past it or put the mask on, spread kindness, help a neighbor, call a family member or an old friend, go kiss your significant other, do something to take your mind to a different place. But you shouldn’t look at depression like it’s a negative thing, because the most depressed people in the world have done some of the greatest things whether it be movies, tv, government, or just anything positive. I’ve learned to spread happiness even though I can rarely feel it for myself, because if I can make someone else’s life better, maybe it can make my life easier, knowing that I made someone’s day and spread a little bit of happiness.

10742243,depression,how do I stop having such a cynical view on making friends?,"So I don't know, I've recently realized that the last ""friend"" I had didn't really care about me and hasn't ever seemed to want to be actual friends

So I've decided to stop putting any effort into them because of it, but now that's left me completely alone,

But I don't really know what to do now, since I haven't made a real friend since middle school, I only started talking to the person I mentioned because like a year ago I was desperate and started texting with them in a very weird, off-putting way

So at this point I don't really know how I could, I've just gotten so afraid of talking to people because it seems clear that nobody likes strangers talking at them, especially if it's late in high school like I am now, most people have their friend groups at this point and don't want to change it

and most people I'm my life have just talked to me for the sake of being polite or to get something out of me, so I just get automatically defensive when someone talks to me, again the person I mentioned above is an example, I did everything I could, they literally convinced me to start working at the place they work just for the sake of having me cover for them, and still they never even considered doing anything in return, even when that just meant asking to talk once instead of texting


So I don't know, I feel like I've lost faith in people just because of my friends leaving me, followed by trying to make friends with someone who didn't care and seemed slightly narcissistic, so what do I do really? What could I do to stop being so afraid of hurting people or being hurt again? Since the way it is now, it just feels like the safest option is to be alone, but I'm sick of being alone, I've been alone for years at this point and I just want to find a way to trust people again",8,1672531017,9,1
